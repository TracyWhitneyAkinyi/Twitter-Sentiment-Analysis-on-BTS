This is a Sentiment Analysis project that employs the use of Natural Language Processing(NLP)

This is a Sentiment Analysis project that employs the use of Natural Language Processing. Using BTS, the world's most famous South Korean band,I felt it would be a good idea to obtain insights into how Twitter users felt about the boy band.This Notebook makes use of several Python libraries like Pandas (for Data Cleaning/Manipulation), Tweepy (for Tweets Mining), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), TextBlob (for Sentiment Analysis), MatPlotlib & WordCloud (for Data Exploration), Emot (for Emojis identification), Plotly (for some Data Visualisation).

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will see how I carried out the following steps for the project:

   1.   Import Libraries
   2.   Tweet mining
   3.   Data Cleaning.
   4.   Tweet Processing.
   5.   Sentiment Analysis
